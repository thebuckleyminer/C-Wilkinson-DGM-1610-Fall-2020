Key items Romrell taught us today:
    - A code has separate components and they all do different things.
    - In the programming world they call these things objects. They call it Object Oriented Programming.
    - In Object Oriented Programming they make these little classes or a script.
    - The instances of these classes are the objects.
    - They are nice because they are small and only do a few things.
    - We use the Transform Object all the time... also called component.
    - Learned a lot about Scriptiable Objects.
    - Learned how to share data easier.
