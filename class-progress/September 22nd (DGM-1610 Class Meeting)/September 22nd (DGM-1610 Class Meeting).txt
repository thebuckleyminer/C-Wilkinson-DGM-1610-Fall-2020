Summary of what I accomplished in this Class Meeting:
    - Created a new CharacterMover C# script for this project.
    - Made a new public CharacterController variable called controller.
    - Made a new Vector3 variable called moveDirection.
    - We added controller.Move(moveDirection); to the update function to tell it to move.
    - Removed MoverScript component from the player.
    - Added the CharacterMover to the player object as a component.
    - Dragged the Character Controller component to the Controller variable slot on the player.
    - Removed the box collider from the player because we did not need it.
    - The Character now stops when it hits the big block.
    - Added Ground Plane.
    - Added a directional light to the scene.
    - Created a var temp variable in the function because he said you should not pass calculations into a function.
    - Implemented a Input.GetAxis in this script to the user can control the player with input.
    - Made some of the variables that are no longer needed private instead of public.
    - Added some code to jump. This contains a if statement for the Get Button of the jump key.

Key items Romrell taught us today:
    People had problems with Create with Code.
        - Talked about how Create with Code uses a Unity 2018 version.
        - If you used 2019 or 2020 you will have to do a package update because it will say your packages are out of date.
        - To import the assets from the Asset store you will have to click download and the press the import button.
        - This is how to fix it if you created the Create with Code with a 2019 Unity Build.
        - It says there are problems in the package manager. You have to go to window -> package manager -> advanced -> Set packages to defaults -> discard current packages.
        - That should clear all of the errors if someone ran into that program.
        - All and all he recommends downgrading to 2018.4.
    Keywords:
        - A keyword is something that already exists in the Unity editor.
        - CharacterController is a keyword, class is a keyword, MonoBehavior is a keyword, void is a keyword that means function.
        - You can't use keywords that already exit or else you will override them.
    - There is a serious issue when using transforms.
    - They will do triggers for us but here is the problem we are going to have... They Ignore Physics! They will move objects straight through other objects!
    Character Controller
        - The new variable object type we are going to use today is CharacterController.
        - Variables always have a name... we always have to name our variables.
        - A NullRefrenceException or a UnassignedReferenceException means that you are missing something.
        - CharacterController is a special collider to move characters around.
        - Unlike Transform. Transform does not know anything about colliders.
        - The CharacterController is controlling the transform.
    - Adding a directional light will help the scene with visibility.
    - To get something to move you need three things: 1) A MoveCharacter script on the object 2) A CharacterController (With it as the CharacterMover script variable) 3) A move direction to say anything other than zero.
    - You should not pass calculations into a function. So make a temp variable with the var keyword in the function and then use that.
    - By using a comma you can declare multiple variables at once with a variable decoration.
    - The default for gravity is -9.81f.
    - The Input of the Arrow Keys, WASD, or a controller gives a float between -1 and 1.
    - We do not want to have some of the values as public anymore because we do not want to see them. We will change some of the public to privates.
    - += means take what ever this already is and add this to it.
