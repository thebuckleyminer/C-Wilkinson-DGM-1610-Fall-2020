    - Changed MonoBehavior to Animal.
    - Created a new cube and named it Mammal and added the Mammal script to it and now we can see that it has inherited the blue skin color.

Key items Romrell taught us today:
    - For create with code, he is just looking for it to be error free. It is practice.
    - Reviewed what we have done so far in this flappy bird scene and what the scripts and objects do.
    - Talked about other mouse events besides on mouse down.
    - Showed what is expected for assignment 1.
    - If Create with Code is killing you, you can do the Beginner Scripting Unity Course.
    - Next semester is fully online.
    - Inheritance Classes!
    - Animal has a class and it is a MonoBehavior.
    - When we made the animal script and then the mammal and changed the MonoBehavior to Animal our mammal now had the blue skin that was in the animal script.
    - We then made a dog object/script and had it inherit from mammal.
    - This shows that Inheritance works and passes down to lower classes. You can now see the variables that have been passed down.
    - Classes force you to do design.
    - A good question to ask is how many of the objects share data?
    - The three reasons of scripting Inheritance : Code Less. 2) Design / organisation. 3) Less Bugs.
    - Inheritance doesn't just use variables it also does functions.
    - Protected void move made it so all players can move.
    - He drew a lot of graphs to show how Inheritance works among objects and classes.
    - You can not inherit from two classes. You can only inherit from one class.
    - Talked a little about interfaces.
    - Inheritance is used to pull data down, interfaces are used to force design.
    - If you want to change a variable you can hard code in the start if you want to.
    - If you are struggling with create with code, try doing the beginner scripting course from Unity.
