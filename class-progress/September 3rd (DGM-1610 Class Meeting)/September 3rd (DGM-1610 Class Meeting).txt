September 3rd (DGM-1610 Class Meeting)

Summary of what I accomplished in this class:
	- Cleared out the MoverScript to "Pretend we did not do it" to go through as a redo
	- Wrote the speed variable declaration: public float speed = 5.0f;
	- Added the Update() Function
	- Created the public score variable
	- Duplicated the cube and named them: Player 1 and Player 2
	- Implemented the Input.GetAxis to be able to use the arrow keys to move the player around the window
	- Added a button from the UI menu
	- Changed the button text to "Up"
	- Added an OnClick event to the button
	- Added the public Up() function
	- Duplicated the button and named them Up and Down respectively
	- Moved the buttons for cleanliness
	- Created the Down Function
	- Created a public variable to hold a value for the jump distance by clicking one of the buttons

Today Romrell Taught us:
	- We need to be concerned about 1) Variables and 2) Functions
	- Write public if you want it to be view-able inside the unity editor
	- Then write the data type
	- Then the variable name
	- Then = means assign
	- Then the value
		For example: public float speed = 5.0f;
	- Functions start with a uppercase letter.... always
	- Functions also need a () and {} for proper syntax
	- You can change the public variable data in the Unity Inspector, Rider will have the updated changes if properly setup
	- An int does not have a decimal value but floats do
	- Control-D duplicates what is selected
	- The input getAxis goes on values from -1 to 0 to 1 on both horizontal and vertical axis-es
	- Buttons have an On Click() function
	- Functions do work
	- If a variable is inside a function you can just use "var"
	- Always end lines with a semi colon
	- String means a string of characters
