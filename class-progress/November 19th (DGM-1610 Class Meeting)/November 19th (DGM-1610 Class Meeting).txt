November 19th (DGM-1610 Class Meeting)
Summary of what I accomplished in this Class Meeting /Key items Romrell taught us today:
    - To move game parts to other computers or projects you export it as a package.
    - Co-routines.
    - While Loops.
    - Void functions run all at once.
    - A function could be called a routine, a coroutine is something that is run besides it.
    - Made the AddForceBehavior C# Script.
    - Made a rigidbody jump with an IEnumerator with WaitForSeconds.
    - Used a while loop to have the block jump a given number of times.
    - Co-routines can run now, hold, repeat, and stop.
    - Update Runs, Repeats, and there are no stops.
    - Made the CoroutineEvents Script.
