Welcoming to the very first unit of this course.
We will be making a driving simulator prototype where the user can steer a vehicle down a road and either avoid or hit objects.
The Three main learning objectives I understand from this video are:
1)	Player Control.
2)	Input.
3)	Translate the input to action.
